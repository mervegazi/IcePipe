# IcePipeGame
**A game where a character tries to advance on a ski, in a twisting ice pipe, without crashing into icicles and stalagmites.**  

-While the character slides in an oval motion on the ice, he tries to collect the emeralds, and if he collects the ruby ​​that comes out occasionally, it accelerates. 

-The character's health decreases depending on whether he hits the ice more or less, he needs to collect the diamond that comes out from time to time to regain all his health.  

-With the emeralds collected by the player, he can buy characters and sleds from the **market** in the game. 

-If the player does not have enough emeralds to buy a character and a sled, they can earn emeralds by watching advertisements.  

## Assets
